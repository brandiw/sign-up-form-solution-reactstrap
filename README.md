# Lab: Sign up Form

Forms are something you will frequently use in `React.js`.

This lab uses what students have learned so far to create a sign up form using `reactstrap`.

In the starter code, you'll find a `create-react-app` project with `reactstrap` installed and a linter fully setup to help stop bugs in their tracks!

You should have:
